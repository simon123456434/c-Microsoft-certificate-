While working through the C# certification course with FreeCodeCamp, I completed a variety of small projects that have helped me gradually build a solid understanding of the language.
The projects themselves are not particularly advanced or complex, as I’m still new to C#. However, they’ve been incredibly rewarding and have given me a sense of progress and achievement as I learn. 

I’ve found the course to be both engaging and enjoyable, which has made learning C# feel less like a chore and more like a fun challenge. 
I make an effort to practice for at least an hour each day when I can, as consistency has been key in reinforcing my skills. These sessions have become a valuable part of my routine, especially as I wait for the next module in my university course to start. 

There were definitely moments where I got stuck on certain concepts or problems.
However, with perseverance and problem-solving, I managed to work through each challenge one step at a time.
These moments of struggle turned out to be some of the most valuable learning experiences.
Overcoming them has not only strengthened my understanding of C# but also boosted my confidence in tackling coding problems in general.
